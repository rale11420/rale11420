### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Rastko, Smart Contract Developer who deeply care about decentralisation, blockchain technology, and computer science in general. I specialize in developing decentralized applications using Solidity, Huff, Hardhat, Foundry, and other frameworks and tools. In addition to my work with EVM, I have experience in Rust, working with the Substrate framework to build parachains, pallets and smart contracts in Ink!. I also skilled in backend development using NodeJS/NestJS.

Beyond my professional work, I am a dedicated private tutor with a strong background in programming and mathematics. I guide college and high school students in CS and various programming languages, including C, C++, and Python, and prepare them for tests, competitions, and certifications. Additionally, I mentor younger college students in mathematics, focusing on developing their analytic thinking and problem-solving skills.

I am driven by a desire to share knowledge and foster growth. I am always open to collaboration and networking with fellow blockchain enthusiasts, developers, and educators. I believe that blockchain technology has the power to revolutionize traditional systems and bring about a new era of transparency, security, and efficiency.
